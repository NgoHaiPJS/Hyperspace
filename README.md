# Hyperspace

Collection of small space-themed web demos. Each demo is a static HTML/CSS/JS project you can open in a browser.

Projects:

- repos/astro-dashboard — small dashboard layout
- repos/exo-maps — exoplanet map demo
- repos/nebula-visual — visual nebula effects
- repos/orbit-gallery — image gallery with orbital layout
- repos/planetarium-lite — lightweight planetarium demo
- repos/warp-console — compact warp UI demo

Open any project's `index.html` in a browser to view the demo. Contributions welcome — make focused, meaningful commits (style, docs, or small features).
